            <h2>What you'll need</h2>

            <!-- unordered list below -->
            <ul> For the filling.
                
                <!-- list element -->
                <li>1kg apples</li>
                <li>140g caster sugar</li>
                <li>Â½ tsp cinnamon</li>
                <li>3 tbsp flour</li>
                
            </ul>

            <ul> For the pastry
                
                <li>225g butter (room temperature)</li>
                <li>50g caster sugar</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>350g plain flour</li>

            </ul>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Put a layer of paper towels on a large baking sheet.<br> Quarter, core, peel and slice the apples about 5mm thick 
                   and lay evenly on the baking sheet.<br> Put paper towels on top and set aside while you make and chill the pastry.
                </li>   
                <li>For the pastry, beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl until just mixed.<br> Break in a whole egg and a yolk
                     (keep the white for glazing later).Beat together for just under 1 min , it will look a bit like scrambled egg.<br>
                      Now work in the flour with a wooden spoon, a third at a time, until it's beginning to clump up, then finish 
                     gathering it together with your hands.<br> Gently work the dough into a ball, wrap in cling film, and chill for
                     45 mins.<br> Now mix the 140g/5oz sugar, the cinnamon and flour for the filling in a bowl that is large enough 
                     to take the apples later.
                </li>
                <li>After the pastry has chilled, heat the oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5.
                     Lightly beat the egg white with a fork.<br> Cut off a third of the pastry
                      and keep it wrapped while you roll out the rest, and use this to line
                       a pie tin , 20-22cm round and 4cm deep , leaving a slight overhang. <br>
                        Roll the remaining third to a circle about 28cm in diameter. Pat the 
                        apples dry with kitchen paper, and tip them into the bowl with the 
                        cinnamon-sugar mix.<br> Give a quick mix with your hands and immediately pile
                        high into the pastry-lined tin.
                </li>
                <li>Brush a little water around the pastry rim and lay the pastry lid over the apples
                     pressing the edges together to seal. <br> Trim the edge with a sharp knife and make 5 little
                      slashes on top of the lid for the steam to escape.<br> (Can be frozen at this stage.)
                       Brush it all with the egg white and sprinkle with caster sugar. <br> Bake for 40-45 mins,
                        until golden, then remove and let it sit for 5-10 mins. 
                </li>
